## openkarte

**openkarte** is a web-based platform for exploring and visualizing open geospatial data. It aims to make public data intuitively accessible, visually insightful, and contextually rich — starting with georeferenced Open Data from Schleswig-Holstein.

## 🌍 What It Does

- **Map-Based Visualization:**
  Displays georeferenced data sets on an interactive map. The initial data source is the Open Data Portal of Schleswig-Holstein.

- **Temporal Data Exploration:**
  Supports visualization of changes over time, enabling users to explore dynamic developments in spatial data.

- **Data Query and Combination:**
  Future support to allows users to query and link data — for example, connecting water quality measurements with lake locations and depths. Input can be made via a simple interface, including natural language queries powered by AI.

- **Flexible Data Integration:**
  Future support for integrating data from additional external databases is planned.

- **Beyond the Map:**
  Visualization will not be limited to maps: charts and graphs will be supported to give deeper insight into non-spatial aspects of the data.

## 💡 Vision

openkarte is not just a tool for developers or researchers — it’s a public-facing platform that makes open data tangible. By visualizing relationships between different data layers, it helps uncover insights, support local decision-making, and foster transparency.
